# Data Analytics Portfolio

This repository contains personal data analytics practice and projects
using Python and common data analysis libraries such as pandas, NumPy,
and matplotlib.

The work reflects hands-on learning, experimentation, and continuous
improvement over time. All code and analysis are my own.
